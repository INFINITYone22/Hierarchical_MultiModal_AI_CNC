# System Architecture

## Hierarchical Modular Approach
The system is organized into independent modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the CNC workflow. Modules communicate via well-defined interfaces, allowing for easy upgrades and scalability.

### Module Roles
- **Design:** Parses CAD/CAM files, extracts features, and prepares data for planning.
- **Planning:** Generates and optimizes toolpaths and process plans.
- **Vision:** Processes sensor and camera data for perception and feedback.
- **Control:** Executes toolpaths, manages machine state, and applies RL for adaptive control.
- **Monitoring:** Tracks system status, detects anomalies, and logs data.
- **Adaptation:** Learns from new data, adapts to new parts/materials, and updates models.
- **Interfaces:** Provides APIs for human-in-the-loop, dashboards, and external integration.

## Communication
Modules interact via APIs or message bus, supporting distributed and scalable deployment.

## Simulation
A simulation environment enables safe testing and gradual automation before real-world deployment.
