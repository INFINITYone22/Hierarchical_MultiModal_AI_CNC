# Hierarchical Multi-Modal AI CNC System

## Vision

**Revolutionize CNC manufacturing by fully automating the design, planning, execution, monitoring, and adaptation processes using advanced AI.**

This project aims to deliver a comprehensive, modular, and scalable AI system capable of replacing human CNC workers and designers, ensuring higher efficiency, adaptability, and safety in modern manufacturing environments.

## Key Features
- **End-to-End Automation:** From CAD/CAM design to real-time CNC control and adaptation.
- **Hierarchical Modular Architecture:** Each workflow stage is handled by a dedicated AI module.
- **Multi-Modal Perception:** Integrates vision, sensor, and process data for robust decision-making.
- **Simulation-First:** Safe, virtualized testing before real-world deployment.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Ready:** Gradual automation with interfaces for oversight and intervention.
- **Adaptable:** Easily retrain or fine-tune modules for new parts, materials, or machines.
- **Scalable:** Add or upgrade modules independently as technology advances.
